# Replace GM Icon

Replace GM Icon v1.2, by Justin Freitas

Fantasy Grounds Classic/Unity extension to replace the GM chat portrait icon.  First, go into the Fantasy Grounds/extensions/ folder and rename the Replace GM Icon.ext file to Replace GM Icon.zip and extract it to a Replace GM Icon folder to expose the files for modification.  Then, replace the Fantasy Grounds/extensions/Replace GM Icon/graphics/portraits/portrait_gm_token.png file with any 40px x 40px image you want to have as the chat icon for the GM.  There are some samples in the graphics/portraits folder that can be used also.  This does support transparent PNG files.  After making the icon replacement, it is necessary to close and open Fantasy Grounds again to realize the change.
