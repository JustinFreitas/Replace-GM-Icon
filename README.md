# Replace GM Icon
Fantasy Grounds Classic/Unity extension to replace the GM icon.  Simply replace the graphics/portraits/portrait_gm_token.png file with any 40px x 40px image you want to have as the chat icon for the GM.  This does support transparent PNG files.  After making the icon replacement, it is necessary to close and open Fantasy Grounds again to realize the change.
